            <h5>Jay</h5>

            <p>I grew up in a family where creativity was like breathing. Both of my parents were artists and my two siblings and I have always followed a creative path. I have been painting for most of my life, first working with oils and later venturing into acrylics, watercolor and pastels. While I am comfortable painting on canvas, paper, or walls (as in the case of murals), many of my pieces are created on found materials, including used wood, driftwood, rocks, shells, and even eucalyptus bark. My work primarily reflects my love of nature.</p>

            <p>My current body of work expresses what I call &ldquo;magical realism,&rdquo; in which I attempt to convey a wistful and parallel universe that is in the world but not of the world.</p>

            <p>Inspiration for my work often comes in the form of poetry and I am particularly moved by the work of Sufi poets Rumi and Hafiz. Additionally, my collection of antique and vintage photographs often provides fertile ground for story. Often, a photograph will send me on a journey of exploration and research, a catalyst for the creative imagination.</p>

            <p>I seek to work from an archetypal place, exploring ways to represent the things that we all know and feel. I like to probe the world of opposites, illustrating either a unified holistic vision or, conversely, one that describes a sense of separateness or isolation. I attempt to create a narrative in my pieces, whether simply in the language of color, texture and shape or, more elaborately, by suggesting a life, a place, a person, or a social statement.</p>

            <p>It is my personal mission and commitment to do what I am able to add to the sum of beauty in the world.</p>
